\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the spin multiplicity of the ground state of H$_2$ and of H$_2^+$?

\item Give the electronic Hamiltonian for H$_2$.

\item Which one of the following changes significantly when going from H$_2$
to D$_2$:  $R_e$, $D_e$, $\omega$?

\item Within the harmonic approximation, say how your answer to the previous
question will change?

\item Give an expression for the matrix element $H_{AA}$ in H$_2^+$ for
1s orbitals ($\gamma=1$).

\item Sketch how the matrix element $H_{AA}$ should depend on $R$, giving its
value as $R\to\infty$.

\item Sketch a molecular energy curve for $H_2$ as a function of $R$,
giving its value as $R\to\infty$.

\item Sketch the curve within the Hartree-Fock approximation.  
What qualitative error does it make?

\item For a molecule with $y_e=0$, deduce a formula for the number of
states it will bind in terms of $D_e$, $\omega$, and $x_e$.

\item Deduce an expression for $x_e$ in terms of $D_e$ and $\omega$
for the Morse potential, for which 
$$
\epsilon_n = -V_0\, \left( 1 - \frac{\alpha (n+\half)}{\sqrt{2\, \mu\, V_0}} \right)^2
$$

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find $\langle 1 | x | 2 \rangle$ for a harmonic oscillator.

\item For a particle on a ring of radius 2, what is the degeneracy of
the 3rd excited state?

\item What is the eigenvalue of $L^2$ of $Y_1^1(\theta,\phi)$?

\item Repeat previous problem for $L_{\text{z}}$.

\item What is $[L_{\text{x}},L_{\text{z}}]$?

\item What is $\langle l,m| L_{\text{y}} | l,m-1 \rangle$?

\item What is the transition frequency between the first and second
excited states in Li$^{2+}$?

\item The usual sequence of atomic orbitals is s, p, d, and f. If
the next set is g orbitals, what is the lowest principle quantum
number which has them?

\item Knowing $E_0 = -Z^2/2$ for the hydrogenic atom,
deduce $V_0$, the expectation value of potential energy.

\item If $\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \lambda \hat{V}$, and
$\langle \hat{V}\rangle = 2\lambda^2$, what is $E$ at $\lambda=1$?

\end{enumerate}

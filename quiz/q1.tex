\begin{enumerate}
\item For an electron in a potential $V(x)$ in 1d, give the Hamiltonian
and write the Schr{\"o}dinger equation.
\item If $\phi(x)$ is normalized and $E = \langle \phi|\hat{H}|\phi \rangle$
for some problem, make a definite statement about the exact ground-state energy
of $\hat{H}$.
\item Find $\langle \hat{p} \rangle$ for the first excited state of a
harmonic oscillator.
\item Find $\langle \hat{T} \rangle$ for the ground state of $V(x) = -Z\delta(x)$,
$z>0$.
\item Normalize $|x|e^{-|x|}$ over $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
\item What is the degeneracy of the level with energy $4\hbar \omega$ for a 2d
isotropic oxcillator?
\item In one of its excited states, a harmonic oscillator has kientic energy
$5.5$ in atomic units. Give its potential and total energies.
\item If, in $7)$, $\omega=1$, relate $\phi(x)$ and $\phi(-x)$.
\item If I add a perturbation $-\lambda\delta(x)$, $0<\lambda<<1$, to the
middle of an infinite square well, calculate the expected change in the
energy, and say if it goes up or down.
\item Simplify $[p^2,x^2]$

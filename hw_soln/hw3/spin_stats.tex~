\section*{Problems from Berry, Rice, and Ross}

a) Do problems 10, 12, 14, 15, and 18 from BRR. For reference data,
use the NIST website, Atomic Spectra Database. (This replaced Mooreâ€™s
tables, and the NBST became NIST). Also check out the Computational Chemistry
Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (cccbdb) from which I got some of the
basis-set results.
\\

10) Put entries in the following sets of configurations in order of
increasing energy. Then check your intuition with experimental results
at NIST Spectra Database.

\textcolor{red}{a) Li, $1s^22s, 1s2s^2, 1s^22p, 1s2s2p$}
\\

\textcolor{red}{b) C, $1s^22s^22p^2, 1s^22s2p^3, 1s^22s^22p3s, 1s2s^22p^3$}
\\

12) Explain why the second ionization potentail of lithium for the
process Li$^+$ \rightarrow $\text{Li}^{2+}$ + $e^-$, is less than that predicted for
a hydrogenlike atom with $Z=3$.

\textcolor{red}{The electronic repulsion from the two electrons within lithium
  ion leads to smaller second ionization potential than predicted by a hydrogenlike
  atom which only has one electron.}
\\

14) The outer electron of an alkali atom may be treated in an approximate way,
as if it were in a hydrogenic orbital. Suppose that one takes the quantum number
for the outer electron to be 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, for Li, Na,
K, Rb, and Cs. What values must $Z$ be given to account for the observed
first ionization potentials of these atoms? Explain why they differ from unity.
\\
\textcolor{red}{Come back later}
\\

15) Use the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rules to find the number
of unpaired electrons and the term of lowest energy for the following atoms.

\textcolor{red}{a) P: [Ne]$3s^23p^3$; $L=0$ and $S=\frac{3}{2}$ and $J=L+S=\frac{3}{2}$;
  Term Symbol: $^4S_{\frac{3}{2}}$}
\\

\textcolor{red}{b) S: [Ne]$3s^23p^4$; $L=1$ and $S=1$ and $J=2$;
  Term Symbol: $^3P_2$}
\\

\textcolor{red}{c) Ca: [Ar]$4s^2$; $L=0$ and $S=0$ and $J=0$;
  Term Symbol: $^1S_0$}
\\

\textcolor{red}{d) Br: [Ar]$4s^23d^{10}4p^5$; $L=1$ and $S=\frac{1}{2}$
  and $J=\frac{3}{2}$; Term Symbol: $^2P_{\frac{3}{2}}$}
\\

\textcolor{red}{e) Fe: [Ar]$4s^23d^6$; $L=2$ and $S=2$ and $J=4$;
  Term Symbol: $^5D_4$}
\\

18) Derive the terms of the configuration $1s^22s^22p^63s^23p3d$,
of the silicon atom.

\textcolor{red}{$S=1$ and $L=3$ and $J=\{2,3,4\}$;
  Term Symbols: $^3F_2, ^3F_3, ^3F_4$}
\\

\noindent b) Deduce formulas for the atomic number of the noble gas
atom of the n-th row, and for the width of the n-th row. Ignoring relativity,
in what row would the atom with 252 electrons be and what is its
ground-state configuration? What would be its lowest energy term?

\begin{table}[hbpt]
  \center
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    Row & Width & Atomic Number \\
    \hline
    1 & 2 & 2 \\
    2 & 8 & 10 \\
    3 & 8 & 18 \\
    4 & 18& 36 \\
    5 & 18& 54 \\
    6 & 32& 86 \\
    7 & 32& 118
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textcolor{red}{Keeping with the existence of $f$-orbitals since
  $g$-orbitals have not been discovered yet. After the 6th row,
  add 32 electrons for the next noble gas atom. This will mean that the
  11-th row will be where the atom with 252 electrons is placed.}
\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{$e^-$ configuration: [$^{246}$Noble Gas]$11s^29f^4$
  \\
  $S=2$ and $L=6$ and $J=4$; Term Symbol: $^5I_4$}
\\

\noindent c) Repeat (b) but with repulsion between electrons turned off,
i.e., purely hydrogenic orbitals and energies.

\textcolor{red}{If there's no electron interactions, lower quantum
  number orbitals will be filled first e.g. $3d$ orbitals are filled before
  $4s$ orbitals.}
\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{$e^-$ configuration: [$^{246}$Noble Gas]$9f^6$
  \\
  $S=3$ and $L=3$ and $J=6$; Term Symbol: $^7F_6$}
